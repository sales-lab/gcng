R wrapper for GCNG.

[GCNG](https://github.com/xiaoyeye/GCNG), by [Yuan et al.,
2020](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-020-02214-w), uses graph
convolutional neural network and spaital transcriptomics data to infer
cell-cell interactions.

## Aim of the repository

  - embed Python code as package data
  - create a wrapper for R, using `reticulate` and `basilisk`
  - create a short script with an example workflow showing how to use
    the wrapper
